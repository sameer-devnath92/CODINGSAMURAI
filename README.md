I've built a fully functional calculator that handles basic arithmetic operations with proper error handling and invalid input management. This project is a testament to my dedication to writing clean, efficient, and robust code.

Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Division by zero prevention
- User-friendly command-line interface
